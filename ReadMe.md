# Data Science: Classical and Neural Network Models

This repository, **data-science**, contains examples and tutorials on various machine learning models, starting with classical methods and expanding to neural networks. The focus is to provide clear and practical implementations using Python and relevant libraries.

## Current Content

1. **Linear Regression**

2. **Lasso Regression**

## Future Additions
This repository will continue to grow with additional examples and implementations for both classical and neural network models, including:
- Ridge Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Neural Network models (using libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)

## Usage
Clone the repository and explore the notebooks to understand the practical applications of these models:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-science.git
